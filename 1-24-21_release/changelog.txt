
********preTP0

-Lots of rendering test files
-Controller interface created
-Combinded rendering code with controller interface


mainv1:
-Shapely is used to help in rendering. no physics

********TP0

mainv2: 
-made airplane into a class

mainv3: 
-Added basic physics to airplane. 
-Made getFaces and renderFaces much less repetitive by making use of more helper functions
-Organized functions in the GameMode class

mainv4
-Made physics independent of framerate. Makes the physics not dependent on the power of the computer
-Sun and randomly generated clouds (made a cloud class)

mainv5
-Made small modifications to the Button and TextBox class. 
-Also added a CheckBox subclass of button that allows the user to easily toggle variables
-Made sky color change based on status of a checkbox on the splash screen for testing of the CheckBox class
-Improved readability of getTValue()

mainv6
-altered how colors are used (They are now kept as tuples until they are being drawn. This allows for scaling the color based on the time of day)
-made ground and plane colors depend on time of day
-moved the daylight checkbox to the calibration screen temporarily so it can be changed without rerunning the program

********TP1

mainv7
-separated out into a few files
-altered ground loading. Generates a large dict and only shows close squares of grass.
-Created transition between following mode and stationary mode
-Stated InputBox class. Put a few input boxes on the splash screen temporarily

mainv8
-changes made to accommodate TrainingMode
-Most rendering functions for GameMode moves to separate file

mainv9
-Added TrainingMode. Constructed framework for it and created "trainingFunctions" to store the info for performing the various
training exercises offered
-Added button to toggle between TrainingMode and GameMode 
-Bushes, altered shadow function to support bushes, make sunPos dependent on an angle, added crashing + forced reset

mainv10
-fixed framerate bug when switching back from controller calibration (did not fix, fixed in v11)
-added control customization for roll rate, yaw rate, etc. and for deadzone
-removed test input boxes from splash screen
-altered drag function to make it proportional to velocity squared
-made the inputBoxVars "drag" and "throttleStrength" ready to be implemented on settings screen

mainv11
-Added "toolbox" to display some variables to the user
-Greatly expanded on the settings screen
-Altered calibration screen so the "reassign" buttons are now my custom user input boxes
-Added more training levels
-Adjusted how variables are re-initialized when the mode switches back to that game mode.
-Put my own shape intersection code at the bottom of the "renderingFunctions" file
-Altered some of the button creation code in calibration to make it less repetitive.
-removed "daytime" checkbox on calibration screen, moved to settings

********TP2

mainv11
-Added more training levels

mainv12
-Added "binoculars" and added a toggle setting for them
-Finished training levels
-Shapely "toggle" in settings
-Made bushes much more efficient
-Added balloons
-Added quit screen
-Started help screen
-Broke checkBoxes
-Minor changes to framework

mainv13
-Fixed checkBoxes
-Added background colors on the screens
-Fixed fontsize bugs
-Fixed camera stuttering problem
-Added filter to framerate to smooth out performance while still basing physics on framerate
-Added text to help screen
-Minor modifications to Bush and Balloon to make them share a helper function
-Added more comments
-Added balloon shadows + strings
-Added "distance" readout
-Added "?" on the help screen and a settings icon on the settings screen
-removed some try/excepts
-slight color adjustments and UI tweaks

********TP3

mainv14
-Added trees (shadows are broken)
-Made an option to not sort the faces of an individual shape
-Combined bush and tree drawing into 1 function so that they can be sorted by distance properly
-Added settings option for grass size
-Added stationary plane propeller

mainv15
-Added rotation to propeller
-Added reset method to plane instead of having it inside the game modes

mainv16-18
-FPV quad + other plane models
-tree shadows still broken
-quad model needs work
-projection math changed to allow for camera rotation

mainv19
-Aircraft switching screen begun
-Added ability to customize plane color to the aircraft selection screen
-Aircraft shadow switched to a stippled polygon. Allows the shadow to look accurate on various surfaces,
such as a runway
-Added a runway
-Created a new way to draw shadows that allows shadows to be drawn when the camera is rotated
-Fixed tree shadows
-Added curvature that varies with observation angle to the bottom of tree trunks to make them appear more 3D
-Removed black outline around trees. Tree color needs to be changed to improve visibility
-Changed how the runway is drawn. Greatly improves performance and the ability to be scaled. Allows for the
runway to now be displayed in drone FPV mode without destroying the framerate
-Modified clouds to use the same "vertical" and "horizontal" radii. Prevents a graphical issue when the camera rotates
